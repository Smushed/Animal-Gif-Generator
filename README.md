## Description

This webpage generates 10 gifs of animals and the ratings for the gifs. These gifs are pulled from the Giphy API. This page will only display gifs rated "G" and "PG". It comes with some pre-made buttons for animals but you can add your own buttons. Not just limited to animals, you can add a button for whatever you would like to search on.

The gifs will load as stills. Once you click on them they will go into an animated state. They will stay animated until clicked again.

Once a new button is clicked a new 10 gifs will populate the page also displayed as still images until they are clicked.

You can also add a new button with the "Add New Button" button. Once "Add New Button" is pressed, the new button will appear on the top of the page and the input box will be cleared. The new button is able to be clicked and will search Giphy for the term you inputted. The user must input a value in order for this to work.

The updates to this page would be related to the styling. For now the functionality works as intended. If I was to make changes it would be to capitalize the first letter and each letter after a space.
